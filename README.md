Codon Frequency Analysis in Salmonella Genome
Description: This script counts the occurrences of each 3-letter codon (e.g., "AAA", "AAC", ..., "TTT") in the salmonella genome.

Key Features:

Parses a fasta file to extract the genome sequence.
Counts occurrences of each codon.
Outputs the results in codons_number.txt.
Required Libraries: None

Execution:

Ensure the required file (sequence.fasta, main.py) is in the same folder.
Open the project in PyCharm and set the working folder as Assignment1.
Run main.py to execute the script and generate the codon frequency count.
